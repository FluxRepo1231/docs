2. **Click on the 'Create Backup' Button**  
   - Once you're in the **Backups** section, click the **Create Backup** button to start the backup process.

3. **Enter a Backup Name**  
   - In the **Create a Server Backup** menu, enter a meaningful name for your backup. This will help you easily identify it later.

4. **Select Files to Backup**  
   - Choose which files or directories you want to back up. You can select specific folders, configurations, or the entire server, depending on your needs.
