## What to Do After Your Purchase

Once your payment has been successfully received:

- A staff member will create an account for you (if you don’t already have one).
- They will provide your account details directly within the ticket in the following format:

    **example@FlareByte.xyz**

### Example:
Your account details will be shared like this:
- **Email:** example@FlareByte.xyz
- **Temporary Password:** [Provided Securely]

If a staff member does not provide account details or fails to respond promptly, please **ping the CFO or CEO role** for immediate assistance. Typically, we deliver servers within **20 minutes** of purchase. If there’s a delay, please inquire with the staff member handling your ticket for an update.
