Adding users to your panel makes server management easier and allows you to delegate tasks. With subusers, you can grant specific permissions to control who can manage what on your server.

## Steps to Add a User

1. **Navigate to the Users Tab**  
   - In the control panel, find the **Users** tab located in the navigation bar.

2. **Click on the 'New User' Button**  
   - Once you're in the **Users** section, click on the **New User** button to start the process.

3. **Enter the User's Email**  
   - In the **Create a New Subuser** menu, enter the email address of the user you're inviting.  
     Example: `Flux@FlareByte.xyz`.

4. **Assign Necessary Permissions**  
   - Assign the appropriate permissions for the user. You can choose from a range of options, including:
     - **Full Access**: Allows full control over the server and all settings.
     - **Limited Access**: Choose specific actions, such as restarting the server, managing databases, or creating schedules.

5. **Send the Invitation**  
   - After setting permissions, click the **Invite User** button to send the invitation to the user.

## Confirmation

Once the user accepts the invitation, they will be granted access to your control panel with the permissions you specified. You can always modify their permissions or remove their access from the **Users** tab later.
